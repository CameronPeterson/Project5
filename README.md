CS2308 Project 5
Programming Project 5 : Class specification (.h). Class implementation (.cpp).

References: Program 13-3 with header file for class declaration and member function definition for class implementation. You may need to refer to program 13-2. Please also ref to Prog 13-14 and header file in section 13.10 for array of class objects.
Input Output file refers to Program 12-1,12-2, 12-3, and 12-4

Create arrays of class objects for 15+ student records including student ID’s, student names, pointers point to each of student’s test scores, and the average of each student’s test scores. 


a.	The student records must be in a file for input including students ID’s, and student names. The file path in the desktop can be located by file property, for example: 
  
  “C:\\Users\\yourUsersName\\Desktop\\filename.txt”

b.	The 10 testScores of each student may be initialized in the program body or stored in a second file for input.

c.	After inputting the file into arrays of class objects, calculate the average score of each student. The call function for average must be a member function of the student class.
 
d.	Print out student ID’s, student names, average scores and the associated 10 testScores of each student.

e.	Your class declaration should include student records as member data of the class. Your function definition should include the average function and other functions as you desire as member functions of the class.

f.	Must use class specification (.h) and class implementation (.cpp). There will be no credit if specification file and implementation file are not used.
